<h2><center>Design and Implementation of a Pipeline CPU based on MIPS architecture</center></h2>

Click here to see the [code](https://github.com/mtzhang1999/Pipeline-CPU).

This project is based on my [multi-cycle CPU](https://github.com/mtzhang1999/MultiCycle-CPU) project.

## Intro to the multi-cycle CPU

The FSM is designed for different instructions. The IF and ID stages of all instructions are the same. The OpCode and Funct of different instructions jointly determine the subsequent state jumps.

The status and control signals of different instructions in the IF and ID phases are the same, and the subsequent status will shift to a different state according to the corresponding instructions.

The number of clock cycles required to complete the execution of each instruction is also inconsistent. All instructions are transferred to the initial IF stage after the execution is completed, forming a closed loop.

The specific FSM design and transition are shown in the figure below:

And the data path is shown in the figure below:

The multi-cycle CPU support the following instructions:

```
lw, sw, lui,
add, addu, sub, subu, addi, addiu,
and, or, xor, nor, andi, sll, srl, sra, slt, sltu, sltiu,
beq, j, jal, jr, jalr
```

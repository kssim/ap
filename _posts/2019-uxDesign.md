## UX Design for a Mobile Flight Booking App
Goal:Understanding UX Design process and as a final outcome creating wireframe of a mobile application. 
This work was the final project of Professional Diploma in UX Design at UX Design Institute.
After defining the user requirements through user research(interview, survey, usability tests), captured the gathered data and grouped these into an affinity diagram.Then came up with a customer journey map. Based on this, started drafting high-level sketch of a mobile flight booking app and then digitalized this into wireframe. 


## Technique
Affinity diagram & customer journey: workshop using sticky notes and gathering of ideas, graphically visualized using MS PowerPoint.
High-Level Sketching: drafted with a number of hand drawn rough sketches to brainstorm as well as to define the navigation flow.
Interactive-Prototyping: An UI&UX tool Adobe XD helped the work to create medium to high-fidelity prototype and Marvel App helped to demonstrate the interactivity 
of the product.
Wireframing: at the end, a documentation for wireframing was finalized which includes detailed description of the UX design of the application and if it was a real-life project, the communication between developers will be based on this. The mockup pictures were finalized using Adobe Photoshop and the PDF document was made with MS PowerPoint.

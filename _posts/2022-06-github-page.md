## Create AP theme
Goal: This is a project for my github blog. 
I actually created a github page, but the contents are fake.


## Technique
To create a github page, you need to know ruby and jekyll.  


## Git Repository
It did not take long to change the existing theme.  
I made it by modifying the ["tale"](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) theme.

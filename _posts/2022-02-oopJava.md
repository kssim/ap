## JAVA Practice
Goal: Understanding the basic of object oriented programming(OOP) language. 
This was part of a Software Testing Bootcamp course. Particularly interesting part of the exercises was to learn the 'class' concept which objects can be categorized/ grouped in a class.


## Technique
Learned the very basic of JAVA as a programming language.
Instead of using Eclipse, for the first time the editor IntelliJ IDEA was introduced and it was very intuitive coding tool particularly for the beginners.


## Git Repository
It did not take long to change the existing theme.  
I made it by modifying the ["tale"](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) theme.

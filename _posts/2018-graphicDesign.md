## Complete Branding Design for a Millinery Business
Goal: Creating a complete branding design guide for a fictional client who runs millinery business.
This work was the final project of the 1 year graphic design course at OfG(Online-Schule f√ºr Gestaltung) which I have earned the diploma with award.
Key components for a brand identity design such as logo, typography, packaging, stationery-set, web & SNS interface are included.


## Technique
For the logo and motif design, after many hand-drawn sketches, digitalized using Adobe Illustrator.
Mock-Ups are finalized with Adobe Photoshop and the booklet was made with Adobe InDesign.

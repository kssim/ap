## Weather App using API
Goal: Connecting API endpoint to fetch data and render on UI. 
This project was particularly challenging as it required to connect a weather API and also open-source image stock site.

relevant picture will be displayed in the background.

## Technique
API endpoint: https://api.openweathermap.org 
Open-source image stock: https://source.unsplash.com
JavaScript played key role in this work.
Overall structure was written in HTML and stylized with CSS.
The editor of choice was Visual Studio Code.

## Recreation Projects
Goal: Replicating well-known webpages to understand the construction and UI layout 
One of the replicated product is the start page of "Spotify" and the other one is an online store of a fashion brand "Victoria Beckham".
Both projects were very useful practicing different styles and positional alignments to arrange the elements on the desired areas.
Another learning point was to get used to open-source toolkits such as Bootstrap and Font Awesome.

## Technique
HTML and CSS are mainly used.
To ease the build, some components are used from Bootstrap and Font Awesome.
For the second project, CSS media query was used to enable the responsive feature.

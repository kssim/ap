  <h2 id="toy-project-1">Weather App using API</h2>
<p><b>Goal: Connecting API endpoint to fetch data and render on UI. </b><br />
This project was particularly challenging as it required to connect a weather API and also open-source image stock site.<br />
In this work, as the keyword entered into the search field, from the weather API, the climate information will be called and from the image stock, 
relevant picture will be displayed in the background.<br />
</p><br />

<p>API endpoint: https://api.openweathermap.org <br />

<h2 id="toy-project-1">TO-DO App with JavaScript</h2>
<p><b>Goal: Understanding the mechanism of how JavaScript enables dynamic functionalities on webpage.</b><br />
This project was a good exercise to practice implementing interactivity on the web such as adding, deleting and refreshing. 
The concepts like "variables" and "methods" were important learning points.</p><br />

<h2 id="techique">Technique</h2>
<p><strong>JavaScript</strong>'s methods e.g. 'document.querySelector', 'addEventListener' enabled the events e.g. adding or clicking to be happened.

<h2 id="toy-project-1">Responsive Home Page</h2>
<p><b>Goal: Creating a landing page for a client as if in a real-life project.</b><br />
This project was a final work for the Front-End Web Development course and the purpose is to demonstrate different elements on the webpage and give the responsive feature which can be displayed in other device types. <br />
Some interactive effects are also applied such as icon graphics in the button changes or the button size slightly scales up when hovering mouse cursor.</p><br />

<h2 id="techique">Technique</h2>
<p> For the responsive feature, <strong>CSS media query</strong> was used.<br />

<h2 id="toy-project-1">Recreation Projects</h2>
<p><b>Goal: Replicating well-known webpages to understand the construction and UI layout. </b><br />
One of the replicated product is the start page of "Spotify" and the other one is an online store of a fashion brand "Victoria Beckham".
Both projects were very useful practicing different styles and positional alignments to arrange the elements on the desired areas.<br />
Another learning point was to get used to open-source toolkits such as <strong>Bootstrap</strong> and <strong>Font Awesome</strong>.</p><br />

<h2 id="techique">Technique</h2>
<p><strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> are mainly used.<br />
To ease the build, some components are used from <strong>Bootstrap</strong> and <strong>Font Awesome</strong>.<br />
